# File Processing Pipeline - Connor Ellis
## Initial Setup


You will need to have python3.x installed, and the following modules:
* [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is used to create virtual environments
* [pybuilder](https://pybuilder.github.io/) is a build tool for Python

To activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies, run the following commands 
```bash
cd path/to/project

# setup new virtual environment 
python3 -m venv venv

# activate the virtual environment
# Note this was written on Ubuntu - you will need to run venv\Scripts\activate.bat if on Windows
source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
Todo
```bash

```
